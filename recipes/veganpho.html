    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Pho is my all-time favorite cold weather comfort food, and vegan pho is no less satisfying due to the iconic spice combination common in Vietnamese pho. I grew up eating countless bowls of pho every Sunday after church in New Orleans that the flavors of pho are embedded in my taste memory. Even the slightest smell of savory cinnamon, ginger, and star anise transport me back to those Sunday mornings with family. Those countless bowls of pho have prepared me to make a satisfying vegan version of this Vietnamese classic, and this recipe and its 30-minute broth has cracked the code.</p>
    <p>The trick to a super-flavorful vegan pho broth is to toast the whole spices—star anise, cinnamon, and cloves. Toasting alongside the spices are onion and ginger, which should be browned, even charred, in the pot before adding veggie broth. For umami, I added white miso and dried shiitakes to amp up the savoriness that would otherwise come from fish sauce in traditional pho. Finally, palm sugar adds a mellow sweetness common in pho, but you will use rock sugar or raw sugar</p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <h4>Broth</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot, combine onion, shiitakes, ginger, oil, cardamom, star anise, cinnamon, and cloves. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until onions are charred and spices are fragrant, 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add stock, miso, soy sauce, and palm sugar. Cover, increase heat to high, and bring to a boil. Cook until slightly reduced, about 4 minutes. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until onion is translucent, 18 to 20 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Assembly</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot of boiling water, cook pho according to package directions. Drain and divide among large bowls. </li>
            <li>When broth is ready, strain to remove solids and return to pot. Add mushrooms and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Add bok choy and cook, stirring, until stems are tender, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat; season with salt.</li>
            <li>Top noodles with broth, mushrooms, bok choy, tofu, cilantro, basil, onion, scallions, bean sprouts, and jalapeño. Serve with lime wedges, soy sauce, and vegan sriracha alongside.</li>
